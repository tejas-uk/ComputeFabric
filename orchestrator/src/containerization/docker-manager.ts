/**
 * @description
 * A stub for Docker-based container orchestration. This file outlines how you
 * might run a container on a Provider's machine using Docker. In the Orchestrator
 * context, you could also test images or query container statuses remotely.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Placeholder function to simulate Docker container runs
 *
 * @dependencies
 * - In production, a Docker library like "dockerode" would be used.
 *
 * @notes
 * - This orchestrator-level docker-manager might not always run containers itself
 *   (the Provider typically does so). However, we include a stub for future
 *   expansions or if the orchestrator needs to manage Docker images directly.
 */

/**
 * Run a container with the specified Docker image and command.
 * @param dockerImage - The Docker image name (e.g. "pytorch/pytorch:latest")
 * @param command     - The command to run inside the container (e.g. "python train.py")
 * @returns A string representing a container ID or handle (stubbed).

/**
 * @description
 * A stub for usage monitoring and reporting. This file might eventually track:
 * - GPU usage (memory, GPU load, etc.)
 * - CPU usage or job metrics
 * - Stats that will be used for cost calculations or debugging
 *
 * Key features:
 * - A placeholder function "logUsage" that simulates sending usage data somewhere
 *
 * @dependencies
 * - None. Future expansions could integrate with a real monitoring system.
 *
 * @notes
 * - In a production environment, consider using a time-series database or a
 *   monitoring service like Prometheus, Grafana, DataDog, etc.

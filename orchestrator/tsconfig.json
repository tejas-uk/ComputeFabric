/**
 * @description
 * This TypeScript configuration file extends the root "tsconfig.json" to enable
 * a separate build for the Orchestrator. It defines "src" as the root directory
 * and outputs compiled files to "dist".
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Extends from the root config so we share common compiler settings
 * - Sets "outDir" to "dist" to contain the Orchestrator's build artifacts
 * - Sets "rootDir" to "src", ensuring a consistent project structure
 *
 * @notes
 * - You can adjust "lib", "target", or other compiler options if needed
 * - The "include" property ensures we only compile files in "src"
